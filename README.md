This is the Carpentries-style lesson on the computational algebra system [GAP](http://www.gap-system.org).

Its development was started by Alexander Konovalov for the Software Carpentry
workshop organised as a part of the [First CoDiMa Training School in Computational
Discrete Mathematics](http://www.codima.ac.uk/school2015/) in 2015. Since then, it
has had several releases, produced in collaboration with further contributors, and has
been taught by different instructors at more than ten different events, the full list
of which is available on the GAP lesson wiki
[here](https://github.com/alex-konovalov/gap-lesson/wiki).
