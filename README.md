This is the Carpentries-style lesson on the computational algebra system [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org).

Its development was started by Olexandr Konovalov for the Software Carpentry
workshop organised as a part of the [First CoDiMa Training School in Computational
Discrete Mathematics](https://blogs.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/codima/school2015/) in 2015. Since then, it
has had several releases, produced in collaboration with further contributors, and has
been taught by different instructors at least fifteen events, the full list
of which is available on the GAP lesson wiki
[here](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/gap-lesson/wiki).

If you use this lesson to teach GAP users, we would appreciate information
about the event where it was taught and the number of learners attending,
so that we can add it to the list at the GAP lesson wiki
[here](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/gap-lesson/wiki). You can
submit it to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/gap-lesson/issues)
or send by email to [obk1@st-andrews.ac.uk](mailto:obk1@st-andrews.ac.uk). We also
encourage you to collect and share the feedback using
[sticky notes as minute cards](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/06-feedback.html#minute-cards)
(in full or in the form of a summary). This will help us in further lesson development,
to which you are welcome to contribute following the guidelines
[here](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/gap-lesson/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md).
