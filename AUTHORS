The Software Carpentry lesson on the computational algebra system
[GAP](http://www.gap-system.org) has been developed by Olexandr Konovalov
(obk1 at st-andrews.ac.uk) for Software Carpentry workshops
forming a part of the annual CoDiMa Training Schools in Computational
Discrete Mathematics (http://www.codima.ac.uk/schools/). The development
has been supported by the CoDiMa CCP (EP/M022641/1).

The template for Software Carpentry lessons has its own list of authors
available at https://github.com/swcarpentry/styles/graphs/contributors.
